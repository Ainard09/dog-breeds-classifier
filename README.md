# dog-breeds-classifier
## Installation
The code was built on jupyter notebook and he should work with python 3* verson above. Required a tensorflow library to run the code successfully
## Project Motivations
This project focuses on image classification and detection of human faces. The state of art of the algorithm for image classification is Convolutional Neural Network and my objective is to explore this image classifier to identify dog breed.
## File Descriptions
* bottleneck_features: resnet50 bottleneck features
* Haarcascade: pre-trained xml file of faces on github
* dog_app.ipynb: jupyter notebook of the dog_classifier strategy
* extract_bottleneck_features.py: python file to import transfer learning model
## Result
The exploration and analysis of the dataset and evaluation of the model are discussed on this [medium page.](https://medium.com/@liadiazeez3/image-classification-task-on-dog-breeds-524cff31cf1c)
## Acknowledgements
I want to acknownledge the guide provided by Udacity throughout the period of this pproject
